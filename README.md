# Industry Trends Project

This project is a simple static site that highlights modern generative AI engineering trends. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files live in the repository root.

## Running Locally

1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

The server serves the files in the repository root, so `index.html` will be the entry page.

## Verifying the Server

After running `npm start`, you can confirm the server is serving the site by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your browser or using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the HTML for the home page, including the title `Industry Trends: The Modern Generative AI Engineer`.
